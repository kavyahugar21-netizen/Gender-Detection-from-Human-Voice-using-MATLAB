# Gender-Detection-from-Human-Voice-using-MATLAB
This project detects gender based on human voice frequency using MATLAB. It classifies male voices below 165 Hz and female voices between 165 Hz and 225 Hz. Voices above 225 Hz are labeled as "unknown" for out-of-range detection. The system uses audio signal processing and frequency analysis for accurate results.
